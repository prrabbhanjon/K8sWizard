<p> In Kubernetes, DNS resolution is a critical component for service discovery. When a Pod is deleted and recreated automatically (e.g., by a Deployment or StatefulSet), its IP address may change. However, Kubernetes provides mechanisms to ensure that DNS resolution continues to work seamlessly in such scenarios.

<p> Forward lookup is the process of resolving a service name to its IP address. Kubernetes uses CoreDNS (or kube-dns) as the default DNS service to handle this.</p>
